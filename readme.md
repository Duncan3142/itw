## Spec

Build an HTTP API with a single endpoint that accepts a number and returns the word representation. Case is unimportant and words do not require comma separators. Include runnable test cases. Write it in vanilla JS.

For example:

- 1=one
- 23=twenty three
- 4678=four thousand six hundred and seventy eight
- 1000001=one million and one

## Assumptions

- Input is a positive integer, consisting solely of decimal digits

## Build & Tests

Run `make` to build the docker image and execute tests

## Launch
Run `make start` and `make stop` to start and stop the server
